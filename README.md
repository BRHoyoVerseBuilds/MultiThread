#MultiThread  
===========

Welcome to the central hub of the MultiThread universe — a chaotic, cosmic, and creative multiverse stitched together by luck, emotion, and an unhealthy amount of imagination.

This repository contains everything related to the MultiThread project, including character lore, worldbuilding notes, visual references, emotional concepts, and more. It's primarily for personal use, but if you stumbled in here, congratulations... you weren't supposed to. Or maybe fate brought you here. Either way, you're now part of the Thread.

#What is MultiThread?  
---------------------

MultiThread is an ever-evolving multiverse of interconnected characters, stories, emotions, and concepts. At its core, it's a passion project — a place where cosmic mascots, chaotic tricksters, emotionally unstable AIs, divine sorcerers, and flirtatious nightmares all coexist under one strange, emotionally resonant roof.

It began as a creative outlet and became... something else. Something alive. Something weird. Something beautiful.

#Repository Structure  
---------------------

├── Visuals/          - Concept art, design references, etc.  
├── Scripts/          - Writing drafts, dialogue, or chaotic ideas  
├── Misc/             - Anything that doesn’t fit neatly elsewhere  
└── README.txt        - You're reading it  

This repo is used for quick access to all MultiThread-related files, notes, and ideas. It's not meant to be polished or final—just functional and centralized.

#Notes  
------

- This is a personal workspace.  
- Nothing here is "final." Everything is in motion.  
- Characters may evolve. Lore may contradict itself. That’s part of the charm.  
- If you get confused... good.

Let me know if you want a more serious version, a shorter one, or if you want me to slip in a special message from Amara-chan or Lustelle 😏
